# Image Analysis for Product Marketplace

## Project Overview
This project is a **Python-based image analysis application** designed for product marketplaces.  
It performs **quality and correctness scoring** on product images, detecting low-quality or fake images.  
The application integrates **Deep Learning models (EfficientNetB0)** for accurate analysis and can be adapted for **web or API-based deployment**.

---

## Features
- Analyze product images for **authenticity and correctness**  
- Detect **fake or low-quality images**  
- Batch processing support for multiple images  
- Easy integration with web applications or APIs  
- Python-based prototype suitable for **academic, startup, or prototype projects**

---

## Technologies Used
- **Python**  
- **Flask** (for web app integration)  
- **OpenCV** (image processing)  
- **TensorFlow / Keras** (Deep Learning models, EfficientNetB0)  
- **HTML / CSS** (if web UI is included)
